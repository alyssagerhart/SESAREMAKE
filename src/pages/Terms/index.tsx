          You may pay for the Services via (1) one of several alternative monthly subscription plans (each, a “Subscription Plan”) or (2) a fee-per-hire plan (“Per-Hire Plan”). To sign up for the Services, you will be required to complete and sign an order form which will specify the payment terms for the Services being provided to you, including whether you are paying for the Services via a Subscription Plan or a Per-Hire Plan.
          You agree to use the Services solely for the purpose of identifying, communicating with and hiring candidates available through the Services to fulfill your staffing needs and for no other purpose.
          If you sign up for the Services via (1) a Subscription Plan and hire one or more candidates in excess of the number of candidates covered by your Subscription Plan or (2) a Per-Hire Plan, then in each case, the applicable per-hire fee will be payable to Significant Edge Sales Academy LLC if you or any of your affiliates employ or otherwise engage the services of a candidate identified through our Services for any position during the term of your agreement with us or within one year after termination of your agreement with us.
          We refer candidates to you through the Services in confidence. You agree not to refer or otherwise identify any such candidates to any other individual or entity without our prior written consent, which may be withheld for any or no reason.
          You agree that any decision to offer employment or engagement to a candidate will be wholly based upon your own evaluation of such candidates suitability under your own hiring process and that we will have no liability to you if a candidate does not meet your expectations or requirements.
          You agree that it is your sole responsibility to provide any candidate who you employ or engage with a suitable place of work, which will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws related to the employment of employees or engagement of independent contractors.
          You acknowledge and agree that we have expended and will continue to expend significant time, resources and money in building our pool of candidates for the purpose of providing the Services to our customers and that your agreement to the provisions of this paragraph is a material inducement to Significant Edge Sales Academy LLC to provide the Services to you. Accordingly, you agree that you will not, directly or indirectly through any third party, during the Restricted Period, solicit the services of or recruit or hire any candidate we refer to you through our Services other than through our Services and then only on the terms set forth in these Terms or in a separate written agreement between you and us.
          Restricted Period means, with respect to each candidate we refer to you through our Services, a period of twelve months after the last communication from us to you about such candidate through our Services.
